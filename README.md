# Express Postgres API

```
Postgresql
passport
Express

# Beginners Friendly Node.js API

I made this server because most of the other Node API's are either too bloated.
Full of things you don't understand or will never use. Or are just plain
outdated.


## How To


Start the server
```
npm run start:dev
```
